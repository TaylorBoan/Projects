# Projects

A brief sample of some of my coding projects in python demonstrating my familiarity with various libraries including matplotlib, scikitlearn, scipy, numpy, animation, etc.

In additional to these projects my co-founder and I created PropaneChat.com. To start and maintain this business I learned selenium, qdrant, SQL, etc. PropaneChat.com

Finally, I have written tens of thousands of lines of code to automate my business TheMapsGuy.com using selenium, GeoPandas, Blender API scripts, and Illustrator JSX scripts. This code aids in the design of thousands of maps, customer service, and ecommerce listings and my online presence.

PROJECTS:
